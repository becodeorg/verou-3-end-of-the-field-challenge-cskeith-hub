Self-Evaluation Criteria
Git

 I have created the repository
 I commit regularly (3 or more times per interface) and with useful commit messages
 I push to the repository often (at least twice a day)
 I provide a README, briefly describing the project

Example of good commit messages:

Add interface 1 HTML structure
Add basic styling for interface 1
Fix CSS centering problem
...

HTML
 My HTML code is valid (check with an online validator)
 My HTML code is semantic, for example:

I use the correct header tag (<h2>, <h3>, ...) to mark titles and subtitles (but not just to make text bigger)

I use a <table> tag only to display tabular data

I use a <ul>/<ol> tag only to display lists

I use layout tags (<header>, <main>, <nav>, <aside>, <footer>) only for page-wide sections

 My HTML code is well indented (if necessary I use an automatic formatter such as Prettier)

 My HTML is accessible (every <img> has a well written and descriptive alt attribute)
CSS

 My CSS is well organized and indented (use an automatic formatter such as Prettier)

 If required by the instructions, my CSS has relevant media queries to make the interface responsive (I test it on mobile, tablet and desktop width)

 My classes are named in a meaningful way

Note: there are 1000 ways to name your classes, you will not be judged on the specific name you choose, but we can see if you chose something random vs. something that makes sense :)

 My CSS produces consistent results on Chrome and Firefox
Overall result

 My end result visually matches the provided mockup to the best of HTML/CSS possibilities
 I use a font whose category matches the font in the provided mockup (where category means serif, sans-serif or monospace)

Extra points if you can actually find a similar font, for example on Google Fonts
 I use colors that match the colors found in the provided mockup (using a color picker if necessary)

I use correct colors for fonts

I use correct colors for backgrounds

I use correct colors for borders

 I accurately reproduce the overall dimensions of the widget, the dimensions of the inner elements, the spacing (horizontal and vertical) between the inner elements

 I align the elements and the text as they appear in the provided mockup (left-, center-, right-aligned, and top-, middle-, bottom-aligned)

 I size the fonts as closely as possible to the provided mockup

 I style the fonts with the appropriate weight (normal or bold) and style (regular or italic) as per the provided mockup

Deploy

 My work is deployed and viewable by anyone with a public URL
 Each of my interface is a separate page linked to my README file
